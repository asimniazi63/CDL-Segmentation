```
Deep Learning Based Land Cover and Crop Type Classification: A Comparative Study
```

### Segmentation Models
1. UNet
2. SegNet
3. DeepLabv3+

### Datasets
We used Google Earth Engine to generate the Dataset from Crop Land Data Layer provided by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Our Study area for analyzing performance of segmentation models is comprised of 9 different counties of state of Nebraska, United States of America. We emphasize on Classifying two categories (1) Cultivated and Non-Cultivated Land Cover (2) Out of Cultivated area we classify the crop type i.e. Corn, Soya Bean, Winter Wheat, Alfalfa Hay and Others.
